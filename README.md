# OpenCvPractice
Some digital image processing exercise It's focused on practicing using OpenCV library and implementation of digital image processing methods.

## Projects
- **1-basics** - Introduction to OpenCV library.
- **2-gamma-contrast-correction** - Simple gamma and contrast correction method.
- **3-convolution** - Implementation of Convolution + some filters.
- **4-anisotropic-filter** - Implementation of Anisotropic filtering.
- **5-discrete-fourier-transform** - Implementation of Discrete Fourier Transform function and it's phase and power.
- **6-inverse-discrete-fourier-transform** - Implementation of Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform function, used on top of previous implementation of DFT.
- **7-geometric-distortion** - Implementation of geometric distortion removal.

## Requirements
This project is using shared libraries, so you need to have these installed on your computer.
